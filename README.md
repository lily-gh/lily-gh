# Would you like to set up your terminal like this?

![Terminal demo](https://github.com/lily-gh/lily-gh/blob/main/terminal_demo.png)


I have made a script that installs and sets up all the required software for this configuration, all you need to do is run this single command:

```bash
 sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lily-gh/devtools/main/p10k/spice_up_my_terminal.sh)"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è _Note:_ you'll still need to manually select the `MesloLGS NF` font family in your terminal's settings.

Feel free to read through the [detailed description](https://github.com/lily-gh/devtools/tree/main/p10k) of what's being installed and set up.
